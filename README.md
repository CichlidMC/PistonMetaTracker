# PistonMetaTracker
This repo is a partial mirror of Mojang's Piston Meta. It is used to track new releases and format changes.

This mirror is not complete. Some fields constantly change, so they're removed to make diffs more useful:
- manifest:
  - each version's url, time, and sha1
- version asset indices:
  - url, sha1, and total size
- full asset indices:
  - all entries for lang files
